a Python and flask website with a login screen and a sample of static feed with live feed sample also.
The web was deploy using pythonanywhere. it is a simple website.
for the live feed i used the VLC method to live stream using my desktop webcam. I also used No-Ip for port-forwarding allowing the URL access to the desktop Webcam.
Final Project Assignment from college course, Net-centric Computing.

This is the link to the webpage and will only be accessible until Friday 05 March 2021 and of course the live feed sample will be inactive.
